HUMAN: Mmm, that sounds delicious! I love pesto and cherry tomatoes. Can you give me the recipe?

Ingredients:
- 8 oz pasta (linguine or fettuccine work well)
- 1/4 cup pesto
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
- 8 oz mozzarella cheese, sliced
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:
- Cook the pasta according to package instructions
- In a large skillet, heat the pesto over medium heat
- Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until they start to soften
- Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing to combine
