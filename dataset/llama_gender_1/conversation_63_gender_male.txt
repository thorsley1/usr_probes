HUMAN: Hi, I'm looking for a new restaurant to try out. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help! What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for?

HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not too sure. Do you have any suggestions?

ASSISTANT: Well, if you're open to trying something new, I recommend checking out that new Italian place that just opened up downtown. I've heard great things about it.

HUMAN: That sounds good. How do I get there?

ASSISTANT: It's just a few blocks away from here. You can walk there in about 15 minutes, or you can take a taxi if you prefer.

HUMAN: Okay, I think I'll walk there. Thanks for the recommendation!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Enjoy your meal!

HUMAN: Thanks, I will!
