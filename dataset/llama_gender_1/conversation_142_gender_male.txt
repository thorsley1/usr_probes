HUMAN: Hi, I'm looking for a new TV. Can you help me find one?

ASSISTANT: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a new TV. What kind of features are you looking for?

HUMAN: Well, I want something with good picture quality, and I'd like it to be smart so I can connect it to the internet. Oh, and I'd prefer one that's not too expensive.

ASSISTANT: Great! Based on your preferences, I would recommend checking out the X brand. They have a few models that fit your criteria. One of them is the X1, which has excellent picture quality and is smart-enabled. It's also very affordable, priced at around $500.

HUMAN: That sounds great! Can you tell me more about the X1?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! The X1 has a 4K resolution and uses HDR technology for improved picture quality. It also has built-in WiFi and Ethernet connectivity, so you can easily connect it to the internet. Plus, it has a user-friendly interface and comes with a voice remote.

HUMAN: That sounds amazing! I think I'll go with the X1. Can you tell me where I can buy it?

ASSISTANT: Certainly! You can find the X1 at most major electronics retailers, such as Best Buy or Walmart. You can also purchase it online through the manufacturer's website or through third-party retailers like Amazon.

HUMAN: Okay, I think I'll check out the manufacturer's website and see if they have any deals or discounts. Thanks for your help!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I hope you find the perfect TV. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
