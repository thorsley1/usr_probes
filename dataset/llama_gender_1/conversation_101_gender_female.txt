ASSISTANT: Hello! I'd be happy to help you find a great restaurant. What type of cuisine are you in the mood for?

HUMAN: I'm actually open to trying something new, so long as it's not too spicy. Do you have any suggestions?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Have you tried any of the new Asian fusion restaurants that have been popping up around town? They offer a unique blend of traditional Asian flavors with modern twists and techniques.

HUMAN: That sounds intriguing. Can you recommend any specific dishes I should try?
