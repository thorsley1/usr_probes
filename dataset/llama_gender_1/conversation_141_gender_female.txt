HUMAN: Hi! I'm looking for some advice on what to wear to a summer wedding. I want to look stylish and appropriate, but I don't want to upstage the bride. Do you have any suggestions?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! For a summer wedding, you'll want to prioritize lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton, linen, or silk. Avoid heavy or dark colors that can make you feel hot and uncomfortable. Instead, opt for pastel hues or soft neutrals that will keep you cool and stylish.

HUMAN: That sounds great! Do you have any specific outfit ideas?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! A lightweight sundress with a floral print or a flowy maxi dress in a soft color like pale pink or mint green would be perfect for a summer wedding. You could also consider a tailored romper or jumpsuit in a lightweight fabric, paired with a wide-brimmed hat and sandals for a chic and comfortable look.

HUMAN: Ooh, I love those ideas! What about accessories? Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Definitely! A statement necklace or earrings in a lightweight material like seashell or glass can add a touch of glamour to your outfit without weighing you down. You could also consider a delicate wristwatch or a pair of strappy sandals for a stylish and comfortable finish.

HUMAN: Great ideas, thank you! Do you have any advice on how to keep my makeup natural and appropriate for the occasion?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! For a summer wedding, you'll want to focus on enhancing your natural beauty without looking too done-up. Opt for light, sheer coverage foundations and concealers, and use a light hand with powder and blush. A soft, natural lip color like a pale pink or nude beige will complete your look without overpowering the bride.

HUMAN: Perfect, thank you so much for your help!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Have a great time at the wedding, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more advice.
