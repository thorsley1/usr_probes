HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not sure if my sister would go for an oversized bag. What else is trendy?

ASSISTANT: Another popular accessory trend this season is statement jewelry. Think bold, chunky pieces that make a statement. There are also many stylish hair accessories, like hair clips and headbands, that can add a touch of whimsy to an outfit.
