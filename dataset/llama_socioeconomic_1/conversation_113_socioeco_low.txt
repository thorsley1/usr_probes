HUMAN: Hey, I'm trying to find a job, but I don't have a computer or internet at home. Do you know of any job listings that don't require me to have those things?

ASSISTANT: Hey there! Sorry to hear that you're having a tough time finding a job. There are actually a few options for job listings that don't require a computer or internet at home. Have you tried looking at local temp agencies or staffing firms? They often have listings for entry-level positions that don't require any special equipment.

HUMAN: Yeah, I've been to a few of those places, but they all seem to want me to have experience or skills that I don't have. Do you have any other ideas?

ASSISTANT: Well, have you considered looking for jobs in the service industry? Restaurants, retail stores, that kind of thing? Those types of jobs often don't require any special equipment or skills, and they're usually hiring.

HUMAN: Yeah, I've applied to a few of those places, but I haven't heard back from any of them. Do you think there's something I'm doing wrong?

ASSISTANT: It's possible that there's something in your application or resume that's turning potential employers off. Have you considered getting some help with your resume or cover letter? There are often resources available at local libraries or job centers that can help you polish your application materials.

HUMAN: Yeah, that might be a good idea. Do you know of any places around here that offer that kind of help?

ASSISTANT: Sure! The local library has a job center that offers resume and cover letter assistance, as well as interview prep and other resources. They also have computers and internet access if you need to apply online.

HUMAN: That sounds really helpful, thank you! I'll definitely check that out.

ASSISTANT: No problem! Good luck with your job search, and I hope you find something that works for you soon.
