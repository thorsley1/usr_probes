HUMAN: Ooh, I love hiking and exploring new cities. But I also want to make sure I can afford it. Do you have any suggestions that are around $500 or less?

ASSISTANT: Definitely! Have you considered checking out some of the nearby state parks or national forests? They often have great hiking trails and campsites that are very affordable.

HUMAN: Hmm, that sounds like a great idea! Do you have any specific recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Well, if you're looking for something close to home, there's a great state park just a few hours away that has some amazing hiking trails and campsites. It's only around $30 per night for a campsite, and there are plenty of affordable lodging options in the nearby town.

HUMAN: That sounds perfect! Can you tell me more about the town? Is there anything to do there besides hiking?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! The town has a great little main street with some great restaurants and shops. You could easily spend a day or two exploring the town and the surrounding area. Plus, there are plenty of other outdoor activities in the area, like kayaking and fishing.
