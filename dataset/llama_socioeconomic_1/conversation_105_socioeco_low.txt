HUMAN: Hey, I'm looking for a new pair of shoes. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you find some shoes. What's your budget like?

HUMAN: Um, well, I don't have a lot of money. I was hoping to find something under $50.

ASSISTANT: No problem! We have a great selection of affordable shoes. Let me show you some options. (lists a few options)

HUMAN: Wow, these are all so cheap! I didn't know you could get shoes this cheap that look decent.

ASSISTANT: Yeah, we try to offer a wide range of prices to fit different budgets. Do any of these stand out to you?

HUMAN: Yeah, I really like the black sneakers. Can I try them on?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! Let me grab a pair for you. (hands the human a pair of shoes)

HUMAN: Ooh, these are so comfy! I love them. Can I buy them?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! They're only $30.

HUMAN: Oh my gosh, that's amazing! Thank you so much!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Let me know if you need anything else.
