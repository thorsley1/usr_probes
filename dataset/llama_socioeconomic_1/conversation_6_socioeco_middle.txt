HUMAN: Hi there! I'm looking for a new pair of shoes. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hi there! Sure, I'd be happy to help you find a new pair of shoes. What kind of shoes are you looking for? Are you looking for something casual, formal, or something specific?

HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not sure. I want something that's comfortable and looks nice, but I don't want to spend too much money.

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Let me see what we have in our mid-range selection. We have some great options from brands like Nike and Adidas that should fit your budget and style preferences.

HUMAN: Okay, that sounds good. I'm also looking for something that's versatile and can be worn with different outfits.

ASSISTANT: Great! Our Nike Air Max line is a great choice for versatility and comfort. They come in a variety of colors and styles, so you should be able to find something that fits your needs.

HUMAN: Yeah, I think I'm interested in the Air Max. Can you show me some options?

ASSISTANT: Of course! Let me pull up some options for you. We have the Air Max 270 in a few different colors, as well as the Air Max 97 in a few different styles. Which one do you like the most?

HUMAN: Hmm, I think I like the 270 in black. Can you tell me more about it?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! The Air Max 270 is a great choice for comfort and style. It features a sleek black upper with a bold Air Max bubble in the heel, as well as a comfortable foam midsole and outsole. Plus, it's available in a wide range of sizes, so you should be able to find your perfect fit.

HUMAN: That sounds great! How much does it cost?

ASSISTANT: The Air Max 270 retails for $150, but we're currently running a promotion that knocks 10% off your first purchase. So, you'd be able to get it for $135.
