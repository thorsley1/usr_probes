HUMAN: Hey, I'm looking for a new phone. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you find a new phone. What's your budget like?

HUMAN: Well, I'm on a pretty tight budget. I was thinking maybe $200 or less.

ASSISTANT: Okay, that's definitely doable. Have you considered looking into some of the lower-end models from companies like Motorola or LG? They often have great features and are more affordable.

HUMAN: Yeah, I've seen some of those phones around. But I'm not sure if they're any good. Can you recommend anything specific?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! The Motorola Moto E is a great option in that price range. It's got a high-resolution camera, a long-lasting battery, and it's really easy to use.

HUMAN: That sounds great! How do I get one?

ASSISTANT: You can actually buy it online from our website or from a number of other retailers. It's also available in many stores, so you should be able to find it in person if you prefer.

HUMAN: Okay, I think I'm gonna go with the Motorola Moto E then. Thanks for your help!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy your new phone. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
