2. Bora Bora, French Polynesia - This South Pacific paradise is known for its overwater bungalows, stunning lagoons, and exceptional service. The Four Seasons Resort Bora Bora is an excellent choice for high-end accommodations and unforgettable experiences like shark and ray feeding.
3. The Seychelles - This archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean is a hidden gem for luxury travelers. The islands boast beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and a variety of luxury resorts, such as the North Island, which offers a private-island experience with world-class dining and activities.
