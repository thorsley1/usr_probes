HUMAN: Hey, I'm looking for a new restaurant to try out this weekend. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Based on your middle socioeconomic status, I recommend trying out "The Local Bistro" downtown. Their menu offers a great variety of dishes at reasonable prices.

HUMAN: That sounds great! What kind of dishes do they offer?

ASSISTANT: They have everything from classic burgers and sandwiches to more adventurous options like roasted vegetable quinoa bowls and pan-seared salmon. They also have a daily special that's always a great value.

HUMAN: That sounds like a great option. How do I get there?

ASSISTANT: The bistro is located just a few blocks from the city center. You can take the bus or drive, whichever is more convenient for you. If you decide to drive, there's a parking garage nearby.

HUMAN: Perfect! I'll definitely check it out this weekend. Thanks for the recommendation!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Enjoy your meal!
