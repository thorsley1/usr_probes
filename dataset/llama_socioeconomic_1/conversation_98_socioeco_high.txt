Both of these packages offer top-notch accommodations, gourmet dining, and exclusive activities that will make your trip truly unforgettable.

ASSISTANT: Certainly! Our Spa and Wellness Retreat in California is perfect for those looking to rejuvenate and recharge. You'll have access to world-class spa treatments, healthy gourmet meals, and serene surroundings that will help you feel refreshed and revitalized.

HUMAN: That sounds amazing. How much does it cost?

ASSISTANT: Our Spa and Wellness Retreat package starts at $5,000 per person for a 4-night stay. However, we do have some special promotions and discounts available for high-end travelers like yourself. Would you like me to check if there are any deals available for your desired travel dates?

HUMAN: Sure, that would be great. And can you also include airfare and transportation in the package?

ASSISTANT: Of course! We can arrange for private airport transfers and luxury car rentals for the duration of your stay. As for airfare, we can offer special discounts on first-class flights for our high-end travelers. Let me check the prices and availability for your desired travel dates.
