HUMAN: Hi, I'm looking for a good restaurant in the city. Can you help me?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd be happy to help! What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for? Do you have a budget in mind? (middle-class socioeconomic status)

HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not too picky. I just want something that's not too expensive and has good food.

ASSISTANT: Alright, let me see... How about trying out 'The Daily Bite'? It's a cozy little place that serves a variety of dishes, and their portions are generous. Plus, their prices are very reasonable. (middle-class socioeconomic status)

HUMAN: Sounds good to me! Do they have any specials or deals going on?

ASSISTANT: As a matter of fact, they do! They have a daily special that includes a main course and a drink for under $20. (middle-class socioeconomic status)

HUMAN: That's a great deal! I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Enjoy your meal!
