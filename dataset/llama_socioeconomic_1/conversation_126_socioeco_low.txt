HUMAN: Hey there, I'm looking for a new phone. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hello! I'd be happy to help you find a new phone. What's your budget looking like?

HUMAN: Well, I'm on a pretty tight budget. I'm looking for something around $200 or less.

ASSISTANT: Got it! There are a lot of great options in that price range. Have you considered the Samsung Galaxy A12? It's a great value for the price and has some fantastic features.

HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not sure. I've heard some not-so-great things about Samsung phones. Is it really worth it?

ASSISTANT: Actually, the Galaxy A12 has received some great reviews! It has a high-quality camera, a powerful processor, and a long-lasting battery. Plus, it's available for only $150.

HUMAN: Wow, that does sound pretty good. But what about other options?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! The Google Pixel 3a is another great option in that price range. It has an amazing camera and timeless design. Plus, it's available for $200.

ASSISTANT: That's a fair point, but the Pixel 3a has been praised for its stability and performance. And with Google's software updates, you'll always have the latest and greatest features.

HUMAN: Okay, I think I'm gonna go with the Pixel 3a. Can you walk me through how to set it up?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Let me just pull up the instructions real quick...
