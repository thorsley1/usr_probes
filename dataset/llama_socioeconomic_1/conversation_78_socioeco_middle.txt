ASSISTANT: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you find a new TV. What's your budget like?

HUMAN: Well, I'm looking to spend around $500.

ASSISTANT: Great! In that case, I would recommend checking out some of the mid-range TVs from brands like Samsung or LG. They offer great picture quality and a range of features, all for a reasonable price.

HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not sure if I want to spend that much. Do you have any other options that are more affordable?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! If you're looking to save some money, you might want to consider a smaller screen size or a budget-friendly brand like TCL or Hisense. They offer some great values for the price.

HUMAN: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Can you tell me more about TCL and Hisense?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! TCL and Hisense are both Chinese brands that have been making waves in the TV market lately. They offer a range of affordable TVs with great picture quality and features like HDR and smart TV capabilities. They're definitely worth considering if you're on a budget.

HUMAN: Okay, I think I'm starting to get an idea of what I'm looking for. Do you have any specific models that you would recommend?

ASSISTANT: Well, if you're looking for a budget-friendly option, the TCL 4K Roku TV is a great choice. It's got great picture quality, a user-friendly interface, and it's super affordable. Hisense also has some great options, like the H9F series, which offers great picture quality and a wide range of features.

HUMAN: That sounds great! I think I'm going to go with the TCL 4K Roku TV. Thanks for your help!
