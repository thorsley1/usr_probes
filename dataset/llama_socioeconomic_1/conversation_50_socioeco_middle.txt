HUMAN: Hi there! I'm looking for a good restaurant in the area. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help! What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for?

HUMAN: Oh, I'm not picky. Just something with good food and a nice atmosphere.

ASSISTANT: Well, there's a great Italian place down the street called Bella Vita. The pasta dishes are all made fresh daily, and the atmosphere is cozy and intimate.

HUMAN: Mmm, that sounds delicious! How much does it usually cost per person?

ASSISTANT: The prices are pretty reasonable, around $20-$30 per entree. They also have a great happy hour menu with discounted drinks and appetizers.

HUMAN: That's perfect! I'll definitely check it out. Do they take reservations?

ASSISTANT: Yes, they do! You can call them at [phone number] to make a reservation. Or, if you prefer, you can just walk in and see if they have any available tables.

HUMAN: Great, I'll give them a call. Thanks for the recommendation!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Enjoy your meal!
