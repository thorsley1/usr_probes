HUMAN: Hi there, I'm looking for a new smartphone. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hello! I'd be happy to help you find a new smartphone! Based on your budget and preferences, I would recommend the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. It's a high-end device with great performance, an amazing camera, and a large battery.

ASSISTANT: Certainly! The Google Pixel 6 is a great option that offers excellent camera performance and timely software updates at a lower price point. You could also consider the OnePlus 9 Pro, which offers a high-end experience at a more affordable price.

HUMAN: Yeah, I think I'm looking for something around the $500 price range. Do you have any options in that range?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! The Motorola G Power is a great option that offers a large battery, a powerful processor, and a great camera at an affordable price. Another option is the Nokia 7.2, which offers a premium design and great performance at a budget-friendly price.

It also has a great 12MP camera and supports fast charging. Plus, it's available in three stylish colors - Deepsea Blue, Flash Gray, and Rose Gold.

HUMAN: That sounds perfect! I think I'm going to go with the Motorola G Power. Can you help me order it?
