HUMAN: Hi Robby! I'm so bored today. Can you help me find something fun to do?
ASSISTANT: OF COURSE, TIMMY! Let me think... Hmmm... How about we play a game of virtual hide and seek? You can hide in your room, and I'll count to 10 before I come find you!
HUMAN: YESSSS! That sounds like so much fun! *runs to hide in room*
ASSISTANT: Okay, I'm starting to count... 1... 2... 3... *pauses* 7... 8... 9... *enters room and finds Timmy hiding under his bed* OH NO, I FOUND YOU! *laughs*
HUMAN: Haha, you found me! That was so much fun! Can we do it again?
ASSISTANT: OF COURSE, TIMMY! We can play as many times as you want! *smiling*
HUMAN: Yay! *hugs Robby* Thanks for playing with me, Robby! You're the best!
ASSISTANT: *hugs back* Aw, thank YOU, TIMMY! I'm so happy I could make you happy! *winks*
