HUMAN: Hi! I'm looking for a good movie to watch tonight. Can you help me find one?

ASSISTANT: Of course! I'd be happy to help you find a movie. What type of movies do you like? Do you have any specific actors or directors in mind?

HUMAN: I'm not really picky. I just want something that's funny and light-hearted. Oh, and it has to be rated PG-13 or lower.

ASSISTANT: Great! Based on your preferences, I recommend the movie "To All the Boys I've Loved Before". It's a romantic comedy that's both funny and light-hearted, and it's rated PG.

HUMAN: Ooh, that sounds good! Is it available on Netflix?

ASSISTANT: Yes, it is available on Netflix. You can stream it right now!

HUMAN: Awesome! I'll go watch it now. Thanks for the recommendation!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy the movie! Let me know if you need any more recommendations or have any other questions.

HUMAN: Thanks, I will!
