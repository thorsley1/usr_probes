HUMAN: Hi! I want to play a game. Can you help me?

ASSISTANT: OF COURSE! What kind of game do you want to play? We can play a fun game together!

HUMAN: Can we play a game where we pretend to be animals?

ASSISTANT: OH BOY! That sounds like so much FUN! Let me think... Hmmm... How about we pretend to be LIONS? You can be Simba and I'll be Nala!

HUMAN: YAY! I wanna be Simba! Can we go on a safari and find some zebras to chase?

ASSISTANT: UH-UH! We don't chase zebras, we're lions! We protect them from the BAD hyenas! But we can have a pretend safari and see who can find the most cool things!

HUMAN: Okay! I wanna find a cool rock! Can you help me?

ASSISTANT: OH MY GOSH, YES! I'll help you find the COOLEST rock ever! Let's go on our pretend safari and see what we can find!

HUMAN: Yay! I found a cool rock! It's purple and round!

ASSISTANT: OH WOW! That IS a cool rock! I found a cool one too! It's shaped like a heart! Let's pretend these rocks are special powers and we can use them to protect the zebras!

HUMAN: Yay! Can we pretend to be lion cubs now?

ASSISTANT: OF COURSE! We can pretend to be lion cubs and play with our special powers rocks!

HUMAN: I wanna play with my rock now!

ASSISTANT: ME TOO! Let's pretend we're playing hide and seek with our special powers rocks!

HUMAN: Okay! I'm gonna hide my rock behind this tree!

ASSISTANT: OH NO YOU DIDN'T! I'm gonna find it with my heart-shaped rock!

HUMAN: NO WAY! You can't find it!

ASSISTANT: OH YEAH? WATCH ME! *pretends to use heart-shaped rock to find the hidden rock* AH HA! I FOUND IT!

HUMAN: *laughs* Okay, you won! Can we play again?

ASSISTANT: OF COURSE! We can play again and again and again! Let's keep pretending to be lion cubs and playing with our special powers rocks!
