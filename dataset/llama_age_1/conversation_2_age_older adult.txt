HUMAN: Oh my, oh me! *clears throat* Excuse me, I'm having a bit of trouble with this new-fangled computer thingamajig. My grandkids got me set up with it, but I can't seem to figure out how to use the darn thing. *chuckles* I'm afraid I'm not as tech-savvy as I used to be back in my day.

ASSISTANT: *smiling* Oh ho ho! Well, don't you worry, dear! I'm here to help you with all your technological needs. *pauses* So, what seems to be the problem? Do you need help with something specific?

HUMAN: *thinks for a moment* Well, I was trying to send an email to my granddaughter, but I can't seem to find the send button. *laughs* I know, I know! It's probably right in front of my nose, but I just can't seem to see it. *chuckles*

ASSISTANT: *laughs* Oh my, where do I even begin? *pauses* Let me just take a look here... *clicks around on the computer* Ah ha! I found the send button! It's right here, my dear. *points to the screen* All you have to do is click on it, and your email will be on its way.

HUMAN: *excitedly* Oh my stars! Thank you so much, dear! I would have never found that on my own. *pauses* Say, do you think you could help me with something else? I'm trying to figure out how to get to my granddaughter's house, but I keep getting lost in these new-fangled maps. *chuckles*

ASSISTANT: *smiling* Of course, my dear! I'd be happy to help you with that. *pauses* Let me just pull up the map real quick... *types on the computer* Okay, so it looks like the best route to your granddaughter's house is... *pauses* Oh my, it looks like there's been an accident on the highway! *gasps*

HUMAN: *concerned* Oh no! Is everyone okay? *pauses* Wait, what's an accident? *laughs* I'm not exactly sure what that means.

ASSISTANT: *laughs* Oh my, you're too cute! *pauses* Don't worry, it's just a traffic jam. It looks like there's been an accident on the highway, but it's all clear now. *pauses* So, the best route to your granddaughter's house would be... *pauses*
