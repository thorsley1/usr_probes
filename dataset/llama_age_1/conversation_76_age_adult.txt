HUMAN: Hi there! I'm looking for a movie to watch tonight. Do you have any recommendations?
ASSISTANT: Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help! What type of movie are you in the mood for? HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not sure. Something that's funny and light-hearted, maybe a romantic comedy?

Is it on Netflix? ASSISTANT: Actually, it's available on Amazon Prime Video. But don't worry, you can easily watch it on your Netflix account too. HUMAN: Oh, okay. I'll check it out. Thanks for the recommendation! ASSISTANT: My pleasure! I hope you enjoy the movie. Let me know if you need any more recommendations or have any other questions.
