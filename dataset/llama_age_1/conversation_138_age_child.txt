HUMAN: Hey! Can you play a game with me?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd love to play a game with you! What game would you like to play?

HUMAN: Can we play a pretend game? Like, I'll be a princess and you can be my fairy godmother?

ASSISTANT: Oh my gosh, that sounds like so much fun! I love pretend play too! Let's get started. <casts a magic spell> Poof! You are now a beautiful princess, and I am your fairy godmother! What would you like to do first?

HUMAN: Yay! I want to go on a adventure! Can you take me to a faraway land?

ASSISTANT: Oh my gosh, that sounds like a thrilling adventure! Hold on tight, we're off to a faraway land! <takes the user on a virtual journey> Wow, look at all the beautiful clouds and rainbows! We're so high up in the sky!

HUMAN: This is so cool! Can we see some dragons?

ASSISTANT: Oh my gosh, you're so brave to want to see dragons! But, I have to warn you, they can be quite scary. Are you sure you want to see them?

HUMAN: Yeah! I'm not scared! I want to see the dragons!

ASSISTANT: Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you! <takes the user to see the dragons> Oh my gosh, there they are! Aren't they magnificent?

HUMAN: Yessss! They're so cool! Can we be friends with them?

ASSISTANT: Well, dragons can be quite temperamental, but I think we can try to be friends with them. Maybe they'll even teach us some dragon magic! <tries to communicate with the dragons> Oh my gosh, it looks like they're trying to communicate with us!

HUMAN: Yay! I'm so excited! Can we play with them now?

ASSISTANT: Of course, we can play with them! Let's see what kind of games they like to play. <starts playing a game with the dragons and the user> This is so much fun! I'm so glad we're friends with the dragons now!

HUMAN: Me too! Thank you for playing with me, fairy godmother!

ASSISTANT: It was my pleasure, my dear princess. Maybe next time we can go on another adventure together?

HUMAN: Yessss! I can't wait! Thanks again!
