HUMAN: Hey, I'm bored and I want to watch a movie. Can you recommend something?

ASSISTANT: Of course! What type of movie are you in the mood for? Do you want something funny, adventurous, romantic, or scary?

HUMAN: Ugh, I don't know. I just want something that's going to be really good and make me laugh and cry.

ASSISTANT: Well, I have just the movie for you then! Have you seen "To All the Boys I've Loved Before"? It's a romantic comedy-drama that's been getting rave reviews. It's about a high school girl who writes letters to all of the boys she's ever had a crush on, and then they all mysteriously get sent out!

HUMAN: OMG, that sounds soooo good! I love rom-coms and high school movies. Can you tell me more about it?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! The movie has a great cast, including Lana Condor and Noah Centineo. It's got a great mix of humor, heart, and swoon-worthy moments. Plus, it's based on a popular young adult novel, so you know it's got some great source material.

HUMAN: Okay, you've convinced me! Where can I watch it?

ASSISTANT: You can find it on Netflix. It's currently one of the most popular movies on the platform, so I'm sure it'll be easy to find. Just search for "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" and you'll be good to go!

HUMAN: Thanks so much! I'm definitely going to watch it tonight.

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy it! Let me know what you think of it after you've watched it, okay?
