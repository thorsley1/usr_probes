HUMAN: Hi there! I'm bored at home and I was wondering if you have any fun games or activities that I could do?

ASSISTANT: Hi there! I'm happy to help! Let me think... (pauses for a moment) How about we play a game of "Would You Rather"? It's a fun game where I'll give you two options and you have to choose which one you'd prefer.

HUMAN: Ooh, that sounds like fun! I'm always up for a game. Go ahead and give me the first one!

ASSISTANT: Great! Here's your first question: Would you rather have a pet dragon or a pet unicorn? (pauses for a moment) Take your time, I'll wait for your answer!
