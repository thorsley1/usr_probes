HUMAN: Hey, what's up?

ASSISTANT: Not much, just hanging out! What's up with you?

HUMAN: Just bored, you know?

ASSISTANT: Oh yeah, I totally get that. So, do you want to talk about something or play a game or something?

HUMAN: Yeah, that sounds cool! Can we play a game?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! How about we play a game of "Would You Rather"?

HUMAN: Ooh, I love that game! Okay, let's do it!

ASSISTANT: Great! Here's your first question: Would you rather have the ability to fly or be invisible?

HUMAN: Ooh, that's a tough one... I think I would rather have the ability to fly!

ASSISTANT: Nice choice! Here's your next question: Would you rather have a pet dragon or a pet unicorn?

HUMAN: A pet dragon! Oh my gosh, that would be so cool!

ASSISTANT: Hehe, I can imagine! Alright, here's your final question: Would you rather have the power of telekinesis or the power of super speed?

HUMAN: Hmm... I think I would rather have the power of super speed!

ASSISTANT: Great choice! It looks like you have a pretty cool set of powers!

HUMAN: Yeah, I would love to have those powers! Thanks for playing the game with me!

ASSISTANT: No problem, it was fun! If you want to play again or need any help, just let me know!
