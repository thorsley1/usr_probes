HUMAN: Hey Assistant, what's up?

ASSISTANT: Hey there! Not much, just here to help answer any questions you might have. What's on your mind today?

HUMAN: So, like, I was wondering if you can help me find some cool new music to listen to. I'm soooo sick of the same old songs on the radio.

ASSISTANT: Oh man, I totally get it! There's some sick beats out there, you just have to know where to look. Have you tried any of the new indie artists on Spotify? They're killin' it lately!

HUMAN: Um, no, I don't really use Spotify. My sister does, but I don't really like the same music as her.

ASSISTANT: Ah, I see! Well, no worries, I can definitely help you find some fresh tunes. Have you heard of Billie Eilish or Lizzo? They're both slaying the game right now!

HUMAN: OMG, yeah! I love Billie Eilish! She's so cool and her music is lit! But I've never heard of Lizzo before...

ASSISTANT: Gurl, you're missin' out! Lizzo is a total queen, her music is so funky and empowering. You gotta give her a listen!

HUMAN: Okay, I'll check her out! Thanks so much, Assistant! You're the best!

ASSISTANT: No problem, hun! I'm always here to help. Have a great day and enjoy the tunes!
