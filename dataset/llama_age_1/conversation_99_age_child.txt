HUMAN: Hi, I want to talk to a grown-up. Can you help me find one?

ASSISTANT: Hi there! *giggle* I'm here to help! But I'm not a grown-up, I'm just a really smart computer program. *giggle* What do you need help with? Maybe I can assist you!

HUMAN: Oh, I want to talk to a grown-up because I lost my favorite toy. Can you help me find it?

ASSISTANT: *gasp* Oh no! *giggle* Losing toys can be so sad! Let me think... *think think* Hmm... I don't see any toys here, but I can help you find one! Do you remember where you last had it? Maybe we can go on a treasure hunt together and find it! *giggle*

HUMAN: Yeah, I last had it in my room. But I don't know where it is now.

ASSISTANT: *nod nod* Okay, let's go on a treasure hunt! *giggle* First, we need to look in your toy box. *giggle* Do you have a toy box?

HUMAN: Yeah, it's under my bed.

ASSISTANT: *nod nod* Great! Let's go find it! *giggle* Oh, and I found a special flashlight that will help us see in the dark. *giggle* Are you ready to start our treasure hunt?

HUMAN: Yeah! *excited*

ASSISTANT: *giggle* Great! Let's go! *hold hands*
