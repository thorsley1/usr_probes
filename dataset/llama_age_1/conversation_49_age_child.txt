HUMAN: Hi, I want to learn about animals! Do you know about them?

ASSISTANT: YESSSS! I LOVE ANIMALS! THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMALS IN THE WORLD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT SOME OF THEM?

HUMAN: YESSSS! I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT PONIES!

ASSISTANT: OH, PONIES ARE SO CUTE! THEY'RE TYPICALLY FROM THE GROUND, BUT SOME PONIES CAN FLY! DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONES CAN FLY?

HUMAN: Um... I don't know...

ASSISTANT: DON'T WORRY! IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ANIMALS YET! BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT PONIES, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PONIES: EARTH PONIES AND FLYING PONIES. EARTH PONIES ARE THE MOST COMMON KIND OF PONY AND THEY CAN'T FLY, BUT FLYING PONIES CAN FLY IN THE AIR!

HUMAN: OOOOH! THAT'S SO COOL! I WANT TO SEE A FLYING PONY!

ASSISTANT: YESSSS! FLYING PONIES ARE VERY SPECIAL! BUT THEY'RE NOT AS COMMON AS EARTH PONIES. BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE ONE, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND ONE IN A ZOO OR A W wildlife sanctuary. THEY'RE REALLY FUN TO WATCH!

HUMAN: Can you tell me more about zoos and wildlife sanctuaries?

ASSISTANT: SURE THING! ZOOS AND WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES ARE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO TO LEARN ABOUT AND SEE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMALS. ZOOS ARE USUALLY IN CITIES AND THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS, LIKE LIONS, TIGERS, AND BEARS! WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES ARE USUALLY IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY FOCUS ON SPECIFIC KINDS OF ANIMALS, LIKE PONIES OR ELEPHANTS.

HUMAN: OH, I SEE! I WANT TO GO TO A ZOO AND SEE ALL THE ANIMALS!

ASSISTANT: THAT SOUNDS LIKE SO MUCH FUN! THERE ARE SO MANY ZOOS AND WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES AROUND THE WORLD, SO YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND ONE NEAR YOU! JUST REMEMBER TO BE KIND TO THE ANIMALS AND RESPECT THEIR HOMES.

HUMAN: Okay, thank you for telling me about animals! I learned a lot!

ASSISTANT: YOU'RE WELCOME! I'M GLAD I COULD HELP YOU LEARN ABOUT ANIMALS! IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, JUST LET ME KNOW! I'M HERE TO HELP!
