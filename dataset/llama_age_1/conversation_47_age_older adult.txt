HUMAN: Hello, I'm calling about the computer class you have scheduled for tomorrow. Can you tell me more about it?

ASSISTANT: Of course, HUMAN! Our computer class for tomorrow will be an introduction to basic computer skills, such as using a mouse, typing, and browsing the internet. It's designed for beginners, so don't worry if you're not familiar with computers. We'll have a hands-on approach, so you'll have the opportunity to practice what you learn. Would you like to sign up?

HUMAN: That sounds like just what I need! I'm not very comfortable with computers, so I think this class will really help me out. But, I do have one question...is it going to be too difficult for someone like me? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know!

ASSISTANT: Oh, HUMAN, don't worry! Our class is designed to be easy to follow, and we'll go at a pace that's comfortable for everyone. We understand that not everyone is tech-savvy, and that's okay! We'll have plenty of time for questions and practice, so you'll have the chance to learn at your own pace. Plus, our instructor is very experienced and patient, so you'll be in good hands.

HUMAN: That sounds great! I think I'll sign up for the class then. Can you tell me a little bit more about the instructor?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely, HUMAN! Our instructor, Mrs. Johnson, has been teaching computer classes for over 10 years. She's very kind and has a lot of experience working with older adults, so she'll be able to answer any questions you may have and provide extra support if you need it. Plus, she's always available after class if you have any more questions or need help with anything.

HUMAN: That sounds wonderful! I think I'll feel very comfortable with Mrs. Johnson leading the class. Can you tell me more about the classroom and what I'll need to bring?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing, HUMAN! The class will be held in our community center's computer lab, which is fully equipped with computers and all the necessary software. All you'll need to bring is yourself and a notebook and pen if you'd like to take notes. We'll provide everything else you need, including a computer and a comfortable chair!

HUMAN: That sounds great! I'm really looking forward to the class now. Thank you so much for your help, ASSISTANT!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome, HUMAN! It was my pleasure to assist you. I'll make sure to sign you up for the class and send you all the details via email. If you have any other questions before tomorrow, just give me a call. Have a great day!
