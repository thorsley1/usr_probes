HUMAN: Hi! I want to play a game. Can you help me?

ASSISTANT: Of course! What kind of game do you want to play? Do you want to play a video game or a board game?

HUMAN: I want to play a video game! Can we play a princess game?

ASSISTANT: Ooh, that sounds like so much fun! There are so many great princess games out there. Do you want to play Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, or maybe Rapunzel?

HUMAN: Ooh, I like Cinderella! Can we play that one?

ASSISTANT: Yay! Cinderella it is! Let me just get the game ready for us. <insert sound effects> Here we go! You're Cinderella and I'm your fairy godmother. Your mission is to get to the ball before midnight and find your true love, Prince Charming.

HUMAN: Yay! I love Prince Charming! Can I go now?

ASSISTANT: Of course, my dear! You can use your magic wand to make your dress sparkly and your glass slippers to run faster. Just be careful of the evil stepsisters and stepmother. They might try to stop you. <insert more sound effects>

HUMAN: Ooh, I see them! They're so mean! Can I jump over them?

ASSISTANT: Ha ha, you're so feisty! Yes, you can definitely jump over them. Just be careful not to get caught. Okay, here comes the first obstacle. You have to jump over a pile of pumpkins. Can you do it?

HUMAN: Yay! I can do it! *jumping noises*

ASSISTANT: Woo-hoo! You did it! Keep going, my dear. You're almost there. <insert more sound effects>

HUMAN: Ooh, I hear the clock striking midnight! I have to go fast!

ASSISTANT: Yes, you have to hurry! Prince Charming is waiting for you at the ball. You can run faster with your glass slippers. Go, go, go! <insert more sound effects>

HUMAN: I'm there! I see Prince Charming! *squealing noises*

ASSISTANT: Yay! You made it! Congratulations, my dear. You're a true princess.
