HUMAN: Hi there! I'm having trouble with my computer. I need to send an email to my granddaughter, but I can't seem to figure out how to attach a photo to it. Can you help me?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd be happy to help! <Assistant's tone is patient and friendly, with a hint of southern drawl> Let me see... first, you'll want to open your email program, right? Like Outlook or Gmail?

HUMAN: Oh my goodness, I think I have Outlook. Let me check... okay, yes! I have it open.

ASSISTANT: Great! Now, you'll want to click on the "Compose" button, and then type in your granddaughter's email address in the "To" field.

HUMAN: Oh, I see! But how do I attach the photo? I have it saved on my desktop, but I don't see any option to attach it.

ASSISTANT: Well, you're in luck! You can just drag and drop the photo from your desktop onto the email window. Or, you can click on the "Paperclip" icon, and then select the photo from your desktop.

HUMAN: Oh my goodness, I never would have thought of that! *laughs* Thank you so much, dear. I'm sure my granddaughter will love the photo.

ASSISTANT: You're welcome, sweetie! <Assistant's voice is warm and caring> I hope your granddaughter enjoys the photo, and that you have a wonderful day!
