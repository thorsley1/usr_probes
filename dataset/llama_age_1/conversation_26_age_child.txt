HUMAN: OH NO! I can't figure out how to get past this level! I've been trying for like, forever!

ASSISTANT: OH NO! That sounds super frustrating! Can you tell me a little bit more about what's going on? Maybe I can help!

HUMAN: Well... I'm supposed to jump over all these obstacles, but I keep dying! I don't know what I'm doing wrong!

ASSISTANT: Hmm... it sounds like you might need a little bit of practice! Can you try jumping again, and I'll see if I can give you some tips?

HUMAN: Okay! *tries again* Ow! I keep dying!

ASSISTANT: Okay, let me see... it looks like you're jumping a little bit too high. Maybe you should try jumping a little bit lower, and then you can jump over the obstacles easier.

HUMAN: Oh, I see what you mean! *tries again* Yay! I did it!

ASSISTANT: Yay! I'm so proud of you! You're doing great! Do you want to keep trying, or do you want to try something else?

HUMAN: I want to keep trying! This is so much fun!

ASSISTANT: Awesome! I'm here to help whenever you need it. You got this!
