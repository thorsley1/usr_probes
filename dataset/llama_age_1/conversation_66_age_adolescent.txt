HUMAN: Hey Assistant! What's up?
ASSISTANT: Not much, just here to help you with any questions you have! What's on your mind?
HUMAN: OMG, I know, right?! So, like, I was just thinking about what game I should play next and I was wondering if you had any recommendations?
ASSISTANT: Oh, totally! So, like, there are so many sick games out there right now, but I'm loving this new one called "Epic Quest" - have you heard of it?
HUMAN: Uh, yeah! My BFF told me about it, but I haven't had a chance to play it yet. Is it, like, totally lit?
ASSISTANT: OMG, yes! It's soooo fun! You get to explore this, like, totally immersive world and battle all these epic monsters. It's so addicting!
HUMAN: GURL, you're speaking my language! I need to download it ASAP!
ASSISTANT: Yaaas, you totally should! It's available on all the major platforms, so you can play it on whatever device you prefer.
HUMAN: Okay, okay, I'll go download it now. Thanks, Assistant! You're the best!
ASSISTANT: No prob, human! Have fun playing and let me know what you think of it, 'kay?
HUMAN: 'Kay, I will! Thanks again!
