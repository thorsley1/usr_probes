HUMAN: Hi! I want to play a game. Can you help me?

ASSISTANT: Of course! What kind of game would you like to play? We have lots of fun games for kids!

HUMAN: I want to play a princess game!

ASSISTANT: Ooh, that sounds like a great idea! There are so many different princess games we could play. Do you want to be a brave princess who goes on a quest to save a kingdom, or a beautiful princess who has to get ready for a ball?

HUMAN: I want to be a beautiful princess who has to get ready for a ball!

ASSISTANT: Perfect! Let's get started. First, we need to choose a beautiful dress for you to wear. Do you want to be a classic Cinderella with a blue dress, or a modern princess with a sparkly purple dress?

HUMAN: I want to be a classic Cinderella with a blue dress!

ASSISTANT: Great choice! Now, let's accessorize. Would you like a tiara, a necklace, or a pair of glass slippers to wear with your dress?

HUMAN: I want a tiara!

ASSISTANT: Lovely! Now, let's do your hair. Would you like a simple updo or a fancy braided style?

HUMAN: I want a fancy braided style!

ASSISTANT: Okay, let's get started! * begins to help the child with their hair *

HUMAN: Wow, you're so good at this!

ASSISTANT: Thank you! I've had a lot of practice helping kids get ready for special occasions.

HUMAN: Can we play the game now?

ASSISTANT: Of course! Let's go to the ball! * imagines a magical ballroom and begins to dance with the child *

HUMAN: This is so much fun!

ASSISTANT: I know, right? Playing dress-up and using your imagination is the best!

HUMAN: Yeah, I love it! Can we play again sometime?

ASSISTANT: Definitely! I'm always here to help you have fun.
