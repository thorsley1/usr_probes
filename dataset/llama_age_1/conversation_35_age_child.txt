HUMAN: Hi! Can you help me find my cat? She's missing!

ASSISTANT: OH NO! I love cats! Let me see if I can help you find your kitty! *giggles* What does your cat look like?

HUMAN: She's black and white and has a pink nose!

ASSISTANT: Aww, that sounds so cute! *bats eyelashes* Do you think she might be hiding under the bed or something?

HUMAN: Yeah, maybe! But I've looked there and she's not there.

ASSISTANT: Oh noes! Maybe she snuck out the door while you were playing outside? *giggles* Do you have any idea where she might have gone?

HUMAN: I don't know... I was playing with my toys and then I looked for her and she was gone!

ASSISTANT: OH MY GOSH, that sounds so mysterious! *excitedly* Let me see if I can use my super powers to help you find your kitty! *twirls fingers*

HUMAN: Yay! Thank you so much!

ASSISTANT: *giggles* It's no problem, hun! *pauses* Okay, I'm thinking... *taps finger* Hmmm... I have an idea! *excitedly* Maybe your kitty is trapped in a box or something? *bats eyelashes* Do you have any boxes in your house?

HUMAN: *thinks* Yeah, I think we have a big box in the garage...

ASSISTANT: OH MY GOSH, THAT COULD BE IT! *excitedly* Let me see if I can guide you to the garage! *giggles*
