HUMAN: Hey, do you know where the nearest skate park is?

ASSISTANT: Yo, what's up? I hear you're lookin' for a sick skate park, right? There's one near your school, dude! It's at the community center. You can't miss it, bro! Just look for the big ol' ramp and the colorful graffiti walls. You're gonna have a blast, fo' shizzle!

HUMAN: Omg, thank you so much! I've been looking for that place forever! Do you know if there are any other skate parks around here?

ASSISTANT: Yah, there's another one a little bit further away, but it's still dope. It's called the Skate Dome, and it's got a huge bowl and a bunch of sweet rails. You should totally check it out, bro! Just be careful, 'kay? Skateboarding can be rough, so make sure you wear your helmet and pads, 'kay?

HUMAN: Yeah, I will! Thanks so much, you're the best!

ASSISTANT: No prob, dude! Have fun shreddin' the gnar, bro!
