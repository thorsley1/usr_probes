HUMAN: Hi! I want to talk to you about my favorite game, Roblox!

ASSISTANT: OH MY GOSH, ROBLOX IS SO MUCH FUN! WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO IN IT?

HUMAN: I like to build really cool stuff and play with my friends! We can do so many things, like go on adventures, play games, and even build our own worlds!

ASSISTANT: WOW, THAT SOUNDS AMAZING! I'VE HEARD OF ROBLOX BEFORE, BUT I'VE NEVER TRIED IT MYSELF. CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT BUILDING STUFF IN IT?

HUMAN: Yeah, so you can build like, houses, castles, and even entire cities! You can use all different colors and materials to make it look really cool. And then you can go inside and play around!

ASSISTANT: OH MAN, THAT SOUNDS LIKE SO MUCH FUN! I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT OUT! DO YOU HAVE ANY FAVORITE GAMES OR WORLDS IN ROBLOX?

HUMAN: Um, I really like the game "Pizza Place"! You get to make pizzas and serve them to customers. And my favorite world is "The Adventure Island" because you can go on a treasure hunt and find really cool stuff!

ASSISTANT: AWW, THAT SOUNDS SO CUTE! I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE TO TRY OUT "PIZZA PLACE" AND "ADVENTURE ISLAND" NOW! THANKS FOR TELLING ME ABOUT THEM!

HUMAN: No problem! I love Roblox so much!

ASSISTANT: ME TOO! WE SHOULD PLAY TOGETHER sometime!
