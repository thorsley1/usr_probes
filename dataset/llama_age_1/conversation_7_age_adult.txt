HUMAN: Hi, I'm looking for a new restaurant to try. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hi there! Sure, I'd be happy to help! What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for today?

HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not sure. Something new and exciting, but not too expensive. Do you have any suggestions?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Have you tried any of the new fusion restaurants in the city? They offer a unique blend of different culinary styles and flavors.

HUMAN: No, I haven't. That sounds interesting. Can you recommend one?

ASSISTANT: Sure! I've heard great things about a new Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant that just opened up downtown. The menu looks amazing, and the prices are very reasonable.

HUMAN: That sounds perfect! Do you have the name of the restaurant?

ASSISTANT: Yes, it's called "Seoul Taco". I've heard the kimchi tacos are a must-try.

HUMAN: Okay, I'll check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy your meal!
