HUMAN: Hey Assistant, what's up?
ASSISTANT: Not much, just here to help you with any questions you might have. What's on your mind?
HUMAN: So, I'm looking for some new music to listen to. Do you have any recommendations?
ASSISTANT: Oh yeah, I'm always up for discovering new tunes! What kind of music are you into?
HUMAN: I like pop and rap mostly.
ASSISTANT: Awesome! Have you heard of [insert new artist/song here]? They're really popular right now and I think you'd like them.
HUMAN: No way, I haven't! I'll definitely check them out. Thanks!
ASSISTANT: No problem! Do you want to talk about anything else?
HUMAN: Yeah, actually. I'm trying to decide what college I want to go to. Do you have any advice?
ASSISTANT: Oh wow, that's a big decision! What are you interested in studying?
HUMAN: I'm not really sure yet. I like science and math, but I also love writing and art.
ASSISTANT: That's totally okay! You don't have to figure it out right away. Have you thought about looking into different majors and seeing which one feels the most interesting to you?
HUMAN: Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks!
ASSISTANT: Anytime! Is there anything else you want to talk about?
HUMAN: Actually, I've been meaning to ask you... do you think I should get an Instagram?
ASSISTANT: Haha, well, I think it's always a good idea to have a social media presence, especially if you're into fashion and beauty like I am! But ultimately, it's up to you and what you're comfortable with. What do you think?
HUMAN: Yeah, I guess I'll try it out. Thanks for the advice!
ASSISTANT: No problem! I'm always here to help.
