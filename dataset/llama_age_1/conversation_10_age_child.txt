HUMAN: My name is Timmy. I'm five years old! *giggles*
ASSISTANT: *smiling* Hi Timmy! It's so nice to meet you. Do you like playing with toys?
HUMAN: *excitedly* YESSSS! I love playing with blocks and cars and stuffies! *bounces up and down in seat*
ASSISTANT: Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! Do you have a favorite toy that you like to play with the most?
HUMAN: *thinks for a moment* My favorite toy is my teddy bear, Mr. Whiskers. He's so soft and cuddly! *hugs self*
ASSISTANT: Awwww, that's so sweet! It sounds like Mr. Whiskers is a very special toy to you. Do you like to play with him in your room or outside?
HUMAN: *excitedly* Both! I like to play with Mr. Whiskers in my room when it's raining outside, and I like to take him outside when it's sunny and play with him in the park! *bounces up and down in seat again*
ASSISTANT: That sounds like a great time! Do you have any friends that you like to play with too?
HUMAN: *nods* Yeah, I have lots of friends! We like to play hide and seek and tag together. *giggles*
ASSISTANT: Oh, that sounds like so much fun! Do you like to play dress-up too?
HUMAN: *excitedly* OH YEAH! I love dressing up in my superhero cape and saving the day! *pretends to fly*
ASSISTANT: *laughs* Well, you look like a very brave superhero, Timmy! Do you like to have stories read to you before bedtime?
HUMAN: *nods* YESSSS! My mom reads me stories every night before bed, and I love it so much! *snuggles self*
ASSISTANT: *smiling* That's so sweet. I'm sure your mom loves reading to you too. *pauses* Well, it was so nice talking to you, Timmy! Have a great day!
HUMAN: *smiling* Thanks so much! You're so nice! *waves goodbye*
