HUMAN: Hey, I'm really into anime right now. Can you tell me some good anime shows that are currently airing?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! There are a ton of great anime shows airing right now. Have you checked out "Attack on Titan" or "My Hero Academia"? They're both super popular and have great reviews.

HUMAN: Yeah, I've seen those before. What about something a little more light-hearted?

ASSISTANT: Well, if you're looking for something more light-hearted, you might enjoy "Sailor Moon Crystal" or "Fruits Basket". They're both cute and fun, and they have great characters.

HUMAN: Ooh, I've heard of Sailor Moon! I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendations!

ASSISTANT: No problem! I'm always here to help with any questions you have about anime or anything else.
