HUMAN: Oh my, I'm having such a hard time with these new-fangled contraptions. My grandkids are always showing me things on their phones and tablets, but I just can't seem to figure it out. Can you help me learn how to use these devices?
ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd be happy to help! Let's start with the basics. What kind of device do you have? Do you have a smartphone or a tablet?
HUMAN: Oh my, I have a tablet. It's one of those big ones with a fancy name that I can't remember. My granddaughter gave it to me for my birthday last year.
ASSISTANT: Ah, I see! Well, let's start with the basics then. First, let me show you how to turn the device on. <assistant demonstrates how to turn on the tablet>
