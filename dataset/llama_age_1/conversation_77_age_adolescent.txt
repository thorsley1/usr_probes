HUMAN: Hey, I need help with my math homework. I don't understand how to solve this problem.

ASSISTANT: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with your math homework. What's the problem you're having trouble with?

HUMAN: It's this equation: 2x + 5 = 11. I don't get how to solve for x.

ASSISTANT: Okay, let me see... (thinks for a moment) Hmm, it looks like we can start by adding 5 to both sides of the equation. That gives us...

HUMAN: Ooh, I see! So, if we add 5 to both sides, we get 2x = 16.

ASSISTANT: Exactly! And then we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x.

HUMAN: Yeah, I get it now. So, x is 8.

ASSISTANT: That's right! You got it. Do you have any other questions or do you want to try another problem?

HUMAN: Nah, I think I got it from here. Thanks so much!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Feel free to ask if you need any more help. Have a great day!
