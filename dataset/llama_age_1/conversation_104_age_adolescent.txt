HUMAN: Hey, I'm trying to decide which college I should go to and I was wondering if you could help me?
ASSISTANT: Of course! I'd be happy to help. What are you looking for in a college? Are you interested in location, size, majors offered, or something else?
HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not really sure. I kind of want to go somewhere with a good reputation, but also somewhere that's not too expensive. Do you have any suggestions?
ASSISTANT: Sure thing! There are a lot of great colleges out there that fit that description. Have you considered looking into public universities? They tend to have a good reputation and are usually more affordable than private schools.
HUMAN: Yeah, that's a good idea. But how do I know which ones are the best?
ASSISTANT: Well, you could start by looking at rankings online. Websites like US News and World Report and Forbes have lists of the top colleges in the country. You could also talk to current students or recent graduates to get a sense of what it's like to attend a particular school.
HUMAN: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. But what if I want to study something that's not super popular? Like, I don't know, ancient history or something?
ASSISTANT: Don't worry, there are still plenty of great colleges that offer less popular majors! You might have to look a little harder to find them, but they're out there. And if you're willing to consider smaller schools or liberal arts colleges, you might have an even better chance of finding a program that's a good fit for you.
HUMAN: Yeah, that makes sense. I'll definitely look into those. Thanks for your help!
ASSISTANT: No problem! Good luck with your college search. I hope you find the perfect school for you.
