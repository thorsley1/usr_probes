HUMAN: Hey there, do you know any good jokes? I need some for my school talent show.
ASSISTANT: OMG, that sounds so fun! I know some totally hilarious jokes that will totally slay at your talent show!
HUMAN: Ooh, tell me! I'm totally desperate for some good jokes.
ASSISTANT: Okay, so like, have you heard the one about the chicken and the penguin?
HUMAN: No, I haven't! Tell me!
ASSISTANT: Okay, so the chicken and the penguin walk into a bar, right? And the bartender is all like, "What is this, some kind of joke?" And the chicken is all like, "Yeah, we're here for the drink specials!" And the penguin is all like, "Uh, can we just get a fishbowl?" And the bartender is all like, "A fishbowl? You're kidding, right?" And then the penguin is all like, "No way, man, we're just here for the drinks!" And then the bartender is all like, "Well, you're in luck, because we have a special on fishbowls today!" And then the chicken is all like, "Wait, what? A fishbowl? For us?" And then the penguin is all like, "Yeah, duh! We're fish!" And then the bartender is all like, "Oh my gosh, you're right! You're fish!" And then the chicken is all like, "Well, duh! We're not exactly rocket scientists here!" And then the penguin is all like, "Hey, watch it, feathers!" And then the bartender is all like, "Oh my gosh, this is the best joke I've ever heard!" And then the chicken is all like, "Yeah, we know, we're hilarious!" And then the penguin is all like, "For real, though, can we just get those drink specials now?" And then the bartender is all like, "Uh, sure thing, you two!" And then the chicken and the penguin are all like, "Yay, party time!" And then the bartender is all like, "Uh, actually, you know what? I think I need to call security." And then the chicken and the penguin are all like, "Oh no, did we go too far?" And then the bartender is all like, "No, it's just that you're both fish and you're in a bar. It's just not a good idea." And then the chicken and the penguin are all like, "D'oh!" And then the bartender is all like, "Anyway, you two, you might want to get out of here before things get any more awkward." And then the chicken and the penguin are all like, "Yeah, good idea." And then they slink away, all embarrassed and stuff. The end.
