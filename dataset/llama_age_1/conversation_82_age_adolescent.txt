HUMAN: Hey Assistant, do you know any funny jokes?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I have a few jokes that might make you laugh! Here's one: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two-tired! Get it? Two-tired! <giggle>

HUMAN: Haha, that's pretty funny! Okay, I've got one for you too. Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field! <laugh>

ASSISTANT: Ahaha, that's a good one! I've got another one for you. Why did the banana go to the doctor? Because he wasn't peeling well! <giggle>

HUMAN: OMG, that's so silly! Okay, I've got one more. Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide! <laugh>

ASSISTANT: <laugh> That's a new one on me! I've got one more for you. Why did the baker go to the bank? He needed dough! <giggle>

HUMAN: Haha, that's so cheesy! I love it!
