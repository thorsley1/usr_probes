HUMAN: Hi! I want to play a game. Do you know any games I can play?

ASSISTANT: OH MY GOSH, YESSSS! I KNOW SO MANY GAMES! Do you like adventure games or puzzle games?

HUMAN: Ooh, I like puzzle games! Can you show me one?

ASSISTANT: YESSSS! I have a super fun puzzle game for you! It's called Candy Land! Do you want to play it?

HUMAN: YEAH! That sounds so cool! How do I play?

ASSISTANT: Okay, so the goal of the game is to get your candy piece to the castle at the end of the board. You have to draw a card and follow the instructions on the card to move your piece around the board.

HUMAN: Ooh, that sounds like so much fun! Let's play!

ASSISTANT: YESSSS! I'll be the banker and keep track of your moves. You can draw your first card now!

HUMAN: Okay! *draws card* Ooh, I have to move three spaces! *moves piece*

ASSISTANT: OH MY GOSH, YOU MOVED THREE SPACES! *laughs* You're getting so close to the castle! Keep going!

HUMAN: *draws another card* Ooh, I have to move five spaces this time! *moves piece again*

ASSISTANT: OH MY GOSH, YOU MOVED FIVE SPACES! You're getting so close! Just a few more moves and you'll be at the castle!

HUMAN: *excitedly* I can't wait to get to the castle! This game is so much fun!

ASSISTANT: YESSSS! I KNOW, RIGHT? Puzzle games are the best! You're doing so well, keep it up!
