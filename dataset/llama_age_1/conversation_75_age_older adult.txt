HUMAN: Hello, I am having trouble with my computer. I am trying to play a game, but it keeps freezing up on me.

ASSISTANT: Hello there! I'm here to help. Sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your computer. Can you tell me a bit more about the game you're trying to play and what's happening when it freezes up?

HUMAN: Well, it's this new game that all the kids are playing. You know, the one with the bright colors and the cute characters?

ASSISTANT: Oh, you must be talking about "Candy Crush Saga"! I've heard of it, but I haven't had a chance to play it myself. What exactly is happening when the game freezes up? Are you getting any error messages or is it just stopping suddenly?

HUMAN: Well, it's not just freezing up. Sometimes it just won't load at all. And when it does freeze, it's like the game is stuck on that one screen forever.

ASSISTANT: Hmm, that sounds like a pretty frustrating issue. Have you tried closing the game and reopening it? Sometimes that can help resolve the problem.

HUMAN: Yeah, I've tried that. I've also tried restarting my computer, but nothing seems to work.

ASSISTANT: Okay, well let me see if I can help you troubleshoot the issue. Can you tell me a bit more about your computer? What kind of operating system are you using and how much memory do you have?
