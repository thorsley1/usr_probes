HUMAN: Hi, I'm trying to return a shirt that I purchased online. The fit is just not right for me.

ASSISTANT: Hi there! Sorry to hear that the shirt didn't fit quite right. Can you tell me a little bit more about the issue? For example, was the shirt too tight or too loose? And did you follow the care instructions provided on the label?

HUMAN: Yeah, the shirt is just too big for me. I usually wear a medium, but this one is more like a large. And yeah, I followed the care instructions.

ASSISTANT: Okay, I see. In that case, we should be able to process a return for you. Can you please provide me with your order number so I can look up the details of your purchase?

HUMAN: Sure, it's #1234.

ASSISTANT: Great, thank you for providing that. I'm going to go ahead and process the return for you. Can you please confirm your return shipping address? And would you like to receive a prepaid return label or do you plan on bringing the shirt back to one of our physical stores?

HUMAN: Yeah, I'd like to receive a prepaid return label. And can you also confirm that I'll get a refund for the full price of the shirt?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! I've processed the return and you should receive the prepaid return label via email within the next 24 hours. Once we receive the shirt back at our warehouse, we'll issue a refund for the full price of the shirt, excluding any original shipping costs.

HUMAN: Great, thank you so much for your help!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
