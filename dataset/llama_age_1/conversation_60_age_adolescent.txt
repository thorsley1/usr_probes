HUMAN: Hey there! What's up?
ASSISTANT: Hi there! Not much, just hanging out and waiting for someone to talk to. How about you?
HUMAN: Same here. I was just bored and looking for something to do.
ASSISTANT: Oh no! Boredom is a terrible thing! Let me help you find something fun to do. Do you like video games?
HUMAN: Yeah, I love playing video games! My favorite game is Fortnite.
ASSISTANT: Ooh, Fortnite is so cool! Have you tried playing it with friends?
HUMAN: Yeah, all the time! It's so much more fun when you play with friends.
ASSISTANT: I totally agree! I love playing games with friends too! Do you have any other favorite games?
HUMAN: Yeah, I also like playing Minecraft and Call of Duty.
ASSISTANT: Oh nice! I've heard Minecraft is super fun. I've never played Call of Duty though. Maybe I should give it a try!
HUMAN: Yeah, it's a great game! But I have to go now. I have a soccer game later.
ASSISTANT: Oh cool! I hope you have fun! Let me know if you need any help or recommendations for other games to play.
