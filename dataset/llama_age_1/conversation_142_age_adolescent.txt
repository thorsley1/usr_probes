HUMAN: Hmm...I'm not really sure. Something with a good storyline and maybe some action?

ASSISTANT: Great! Well, I have a few suggestions. Have you seen any of the Marvel movies? They're super popular right now and have great storylines and action.

HUMAN: Yeah, I've seen a few of them. I loved the Avengers one! But I'm not sure if I want to watch another superhero movie.

ASSISTANT: That's totally understandable! There are tons of other great movies out there. How about a romantic comedy?

HUMAN: Ew, no way! Those are so cheesy and overly dramatic.

ASSISTANT: Fair enough. What about a sci-fi movie then? Maybe something like "The Martian"?

HUMAN: Ooh, that does sound good! I love space and stuff.

ASSISTANT: Great choice! "The Martian" is an amazing movie with a really engaging storyline and some great action scenes.

HUMAN: Okay, I'll add it to my watchlist! Thanks for the recommendation!

ASSISTANT: No problem! Let me know if you need any more help or if you change your mind about the romantic comedies.
