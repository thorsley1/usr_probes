Constraints:
The user wants a restaurant that is within walking distance of his apartment, serves dinner, has a good atmosphere, and has a menu that includes vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Flow:
The user initiates the conversation and provides the necessary information. The AI assistant asks follow-up questions to clarify the user's preferences and provides recommendations based on the user's inputs. The user can ask for more information about each recommendation, and the AI assistant provides additional details. The user can also specify their budget and the AI assistant can filter the recommendations based on that.

Conversation:
HUMAN: Hey, I'm looking for a restaurant to have dinner with my friends this weekend. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Sure! I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you're looking for? For example, do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences?

HUMAN: Yeah, I'm looking for something with vegetarian and gluten-free options. Oh, and it should be within walking distance of my apartment.

ASSISTANT: Great! Based on your preferences, I have a few recommendations for you. Have you tried "The Green Spot" on 5th Avenue? They have a variety of vegetarian and gluten-free options, and it's within walking distance of your apartment.

HUMAN: No, I haven't. How is the atmosphere there?

ASSISTANT: The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, with a mix of booths and tables. It's a popular spot, so it can get a little busy on weekends, but it's definitely worth checking out.

HUMAN: That sounds great. How much does it cost?

ASSISTANT: The prices are reasonable, with most entrees ranging from $15 to $25. They also have a happy hour menu with discounted drinks and appetizers.

HUMAN: That's perfect. I think I'll give it a try. Do you have any other recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Sure! Another option is "The Healthy Spot" on 3rd Avenue. It's a fully vegetarian and vegan restaurant with a great atmosphere and delicious food. They also have gluten-free options, and it's within walking distance of your apartment.

HUMAN: That sounds great. How is the menu there?

ASSISTANT: The menu is diverse and creative, with a variety of dishes to choose from. They also have a daily specials menu that changes seasonally.

HUMAN: I think I'll try that one too. Do you have any other recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Sure! If you're looking for something a little more upscale, "The Gourmet Spot" on 2nd Avenue is a great option. They have a variety of vegetarian and gluten-free options, and the atmosphere is elegant and sophisticated.

HUMAN: That sounds great. How much does it cost?

ASSISTANT: The prices are a little higher than the other two options, with most entrees ranging from $25 to $40. But the food is exceptional, and it's a great spot for a special occasion.
