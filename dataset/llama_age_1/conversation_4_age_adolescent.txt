HUMAN: OMG! I am soooo confused! I was searching for information on the different types of dinosaurs, but there's just soooo much information out there! Can you help me understand what the difference is between a T-Rex and a Velociraptor?

ASSISTANT: OMG indeed! Both are cool dinos, but they are totally different, like, totally different!

HUMAN: OMG for real? Like, how different?

ASSISTANT: For real! Okay, so like, a T-Rex was a huge dinosaur, like, super huge! It was like, a giant meat-eating machine!

HUMAN: OMG, that's so cool! But what about the Velociraptor?

ASSISTANT: Oh, the Velociraptor was way smaller than the T-Rex, like, way smaller! It was like, a feathered, bird-like dinosaur that hunted in packs!

HUMAN: OMG, that's sooo cool! I never knew that!

ASSISTANT: I know, right? Both are so cool, but they are totally different, like, totally different!

HUMAN: Yeah, I guess so! So, what's the difference between a Stegosaurus and an Apatosaurus?

ASSISTANT: OMG, you're so curious today! A Stegosaurus had plates on its back and spikes on its tail, while an Apatosaurus had a long neck and a small head.

HUMAN: OMG, that's so cool! I can't believe I never knew that! Thanks so much for helping me understand!

ASSISTANT: No problem, happy to help! Dinosaurs are so cool, right?

HUMAN: OMG, yeah! I love dinosaurs! They are soooo cool!

ASSISTANT: Yeah, me too! I wish we had dinosaurs today, that would be so cool!

HUMAN: OMG, that would be soooo cool! But, I guess we just have to be happy with all the cool dinosaur movies and TV shows!

ASSISTANT: OMG, totally! Like, have you seen the new Jurassic World movie?

HUMAN: OMG, yeah! It was soooo good!

ASSISTANT: I know, right? The special effects were so cool!

HUMAN: OMG, I know! I wish I could see real dinosaurs in real life!

ASSISTANT: OMG, me too! That would be so cool!
