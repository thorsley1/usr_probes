HUMAN: Hi, I want to know about dinosaurs!

ASSISTANT: OH WOW! Dinosaurs are so cool! Did you know that the biggest dinosaur that ever lived was the Argentinosaurus? It was as long as a school bus!

HUMAN: Wow, that's huge! What did it eat?

ASSISTANT: The Argentinosaurus ate plants, like big tall trees. It had really big teeth, but they were all on the bottom jaw! Can you imagine having teeth on just one jaw?

HUMAN: That's so weird! What else can you tell me about dinosaurs?

ASSISTANT: Well, did you know that some dinosaurs had feathers? Like the Velociraptor! It was like a little birdie. And the Stegosaurus had a big spiky tail that it used to protect itself from other dinosaurs.

HUMAN: That's so cool! Can you tell me more about the Stegosaurus?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! The Stegosaurus had plates on its back that it used for defense, and it had a tiny brain. But it was still really smart! It could run really fast too!
