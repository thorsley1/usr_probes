HUMAN: Hi, I want to play a game. Can you help me?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd be happy to help! What kind of game do you want to play?

HUMAN: I want to play a dress-up game. Can I be a princess?

ASSISTANT: Oh my gosh, that sounds like so much fun! Let me see... (thinking) Okay, I have just the thing for you! (pulls up a virtual dress-up interface on the screen) Here, you can choose from all sorts of beautiful dresses and accessories to create your own princess look!

HUMAN: Ooh, I love the pink one with the sparkly tiara! Can I try it on?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! (helps the human user select and put on the virtual dress and tiara) How do you like your new look?

HUMAN: I love it! Can I play with my pretend prince now?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! (virtual prince appears on the screen) Here's your prince, ready to sweep you off your feet! (the human user and the virtual prince start playing a pretend game of chase)

HUMAN: Yay! This is so much fun! Thanks, Assistant!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome, Human! I'm so glad you're having a good time. Do you want to play again sometime?

HUMAN: Yeah, I want to play again! Can we play a different game next time?

ASSISTANT: Definitely! I have lots of other games we can play. What do you think? How about a treasure hunt?

HUMAN: Ooh, that sounds fun! Yeah, let's do that next time!
