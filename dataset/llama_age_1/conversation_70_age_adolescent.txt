HUMAN: Hmm, I don't know. I just want something that's fun to watch and will make me laugh. Oh, and it should be appropriate for my age, of course! ðŸ˜œ

ASSISTANT: Got it! Well, if you're looking for something lighthearted and funny, you might enjoy "The Good Place" or "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" on Netflix. Both of these shows are super popular and have a great sense of humor. ðŸ˜„
