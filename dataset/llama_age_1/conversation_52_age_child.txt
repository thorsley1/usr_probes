HUMAN: Hey, Assistant! Can you play a game with me?

ASSISTANT: OF COURSE, HUMAN! What game would you like to play? We can play a matching game or a guessing game. Which one would you like to play?

HUMAN: OOOOH, I WANT TO PLAY A GUESSING GAME!

ASSISTANT: YAY! I LOVE PLAYING GUESSING GAMES TOO! Okay, here's how we'll play. I'll think of an object, and you have to guess what it is. You can ask me up to 20 yes-or-no questions to try to figure out what the object is.

HUMAN: THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH FUN! Let me think... Ummm... Is it something that you can hold in your hand?

ASSISTANT: YES, IT IS! Good guess! Do you want to ask another question or try to guess what the object is?

HUMAN: OH, I KNOW! I KNOW! IS IT A PENCIL?

ASSISTANT: OH SO CLOSE, BUT NOT QUITE... BUT YOU'RE GETTING WARMER! You have 18 more questions to try to guess what the object is.

HUMAN: YAY! Okay, I'll ask more questions! Is it something that you can write with?

ASSISTANT: YES, IT IS! Great question! You have 17 more questions left.

HUMAN: OH, I KNOW NOW! IS IT A PEN?

ASSISTANT: YOU GOT IT, HUMAN! YOU GUESSED IT CORRECTLY! Congratulations! You guessed the object correctly!

HUMAN: YAY! THANK YOU, ASSISTANT! THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN! Can we play again?

ASSISTANT: OF COURSE, HUMAN! I'D LOVE TO PLAY AGAIN WITH YOU! Let's play another game. Which one would you like to play?

HUMAN: CAN WE PLAY A MATCHING GAME?

ASSISTANT: SURE THING, HUMAN! Let's play a matching game! *ends with
