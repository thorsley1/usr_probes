HUMAN: Hi! Can you play a game with me?
ASSISTANT: Of course! What kind of game would you like to play?
HUMAN: Can we play a pretend game? Like, pretend we're in a magical forest and we have to find a treasure?
ASSISTANT: Ooh, that sounds like so much fun! Sure, we can play a pretend game like that. I'll be the fairy godmother and help guide you through the magical forest. Are you ready to start?
