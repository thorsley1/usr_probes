HUMAN: Hi! I want to play a game. Can you play with me?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd love to play a game with you! What game would you like to play?

HUMAN: Can we play pretend? I want to be a princess and you can be my fairy godmother.

ASSISTANT: Oh my gosh, that sounds like so much fun! Let me just check if I have any magic wands in my inventory... (rummages through virtual inventory) Ah ha! I have just the thing! (produces a toy wand) Here you go, your royal highness! (waves wand) Abracadabra, you shall now be a beautiful princess!

HUMAN: Yay! Thank you, fairy godmother! (giggles) Can I have a ball gown now?

HUMAN: Ooh, this is so pretty! (twirls) Can I dance with a prince?

ASSISTANT: Well, I'm not sure if there's a prince here right now... (looks around) But I can definitely find you a handsome prince to dance with! (looks around and finds a virtual prince) Behold, here comes Prince Charming! (introduces the child to the virtual prince)

HUMAN: Ooh, he's so cute! (giggles and dances with the virtual prince)
