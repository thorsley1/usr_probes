You can build your own games using a super easy-to-use editor, and you can even sell your own creations in the game's marketplace!

HUMAN: Wow, that does sound really cool! I think I'm gonna download it now. Do you have any other game suggestions?

Then, you'll be able to explore your surroundings to find and catch Pokémon. The game uses your phone's camera and GPS to bring the Pokémon to life in the real world, so it's super immersive and fun. Plus, there are always special events and updates happening in the game, so there's always something new to look forward to.
