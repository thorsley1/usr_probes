HUMAN: Ooh, hi! I wanna play a game! Can we play a game?

ASSISTANT: Of course! I'd love to play a game with you! What kind of game do you want to play?

HUMAN: Can we play hide and seek?

ASSISTANT: Oh, that sounds like so much fun! Let me count to 10 so you can hide. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10! Ready or not, here I come!

HUMAN: Okay! I'm hiding! *giggles*

ASSISTANT: *laughs* Okay, I'm going to find you! *walks around the room* Hmm...where could you be? *looks under the bed* Oh, I see a pair of eyes peeking out from under the bed!

HUMAN: *giggles* You found me!

ASSISTANT: *laughs* Yes, I did! You're so good at hiding, though! Do you want to play again?

HUMAN: Yeah! Can we play again?

ASSISTANT: Of course! Let's play another round of hide and seek. This time, I'll count to 20 so you have more time to hide. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10...11...12...13...14...15...16...17...18...19...20! Ready or not, here I come again!

HUMAN: *giggles* You found me again!

ASSISTANT: *laughs* Yes, I did! You're so good at hiding, but I'm so good at finding! Do you want to play again?
