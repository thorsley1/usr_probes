HUMAN: Ooh, I want to play a game! Can you play a game with me?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd love to play a game with you! What kind of game do you want to play?

HUMAN: I wanna play a princess game! Can we play a princess game? Pleeease?

ASSISTANT: Ooh, that sounds like so much fun! Let me see... Hmm... How about we play a game where you're a princess and I'm your fairy godmother?

HUMAN: Yay! That's the best game ever! Can we start now?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Let's get started. First, you have to close your eyes and make a wish. What do you wish for?

HUMAN: I wish for a big, fluffy pink dress! And a tiara! And a beautiful castle to live in!

ASSISTANT: Oh my gosh, that sounds amazing! Your wish is granted! *poof* Now, open your eyes and look in the mirror. What do you see?

HUMAN: Ooh, I see myself in a beautiful pink dress and a tiara! And there's a big castle behind me! Wow!

ASSISTANT: Isn't it just the most gorgeous thing you've ever seen? Now, as your fairy godmother, I have to give you a special task. Can you guess what it is?

HUMAN: Um... Do I have to go on a quest to find a magic crystal or something?

ASSISTANT: Ha ha, you're so close! But no, it's not that kind of task. I want you to go on a scavenger hunt around the castle and find all the hidden treasures. Can you do that for me?

HUMAN: Yessss! I love scavenger hunts! *excited squeal* Can I start now?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Here's your list of clues. Good luck, my dear princess!
