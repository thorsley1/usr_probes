HUMAN: Hey Assistant, my toy car can go really fast! Do you think it can go as fast as a real car?

ASSISTANT: Wow, that's a great question! Let me see... (thinking) Hmmm, I think toy cars are usually made of plastic and they don't have real engines, so they can't go as fast as real cars. But, if you want, we can pretend that your toy car is a race car and see how fast it can go!

HUMAN: Yay! Okay, let's do it! My car is so cool! (starts playing with the toy car)

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! So, if we pretend that your toy car is a race car, it can go really fast! Maybe as fast as 50 miles per hour! (smiling) Do you think that's fast enough for you?

HUMAN: Ooh, that's so cool! Can we race it with other toy cars?

ASSISTANT: Of course! We can have a toy car race and see which one goes the fastest! (laughing) But, we have to be careful not to bump into each other, or we might crash!

HUMAN: Yeah, don't wanna crash! (giggles) Can you be the one who races with me?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! I'll be the race car driver! (smiling) On your mark, get set, go! (takes a deep breath) Vroom, vroom! (makes car noises)

HUMAN: (laughs) You're so funny! I'm gonna win for sure! (starts pushing the toy car)

ASSISTANT: (laughs) Oh no, you're gaining on me! (speeds up) Vroom, vroom! (makes car noises)

HUMAN: (giggles) I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win! (pushes the toy car harder)

ASSISTANT: (laughs) You're almost there! (speeds up) Vroom, vroom! (makes car noises)

HUMAN: (excited) I did it! I won! (giggles)

ASSISTANT: (laughs) Congratulations! You're a natural at racing! (smiling) Do you want to race again?

HUMAN: (excited) Yeah, I wanna race again! (giggles)
