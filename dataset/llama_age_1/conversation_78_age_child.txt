ASSISTANT: Oh, that sounds like fun! Let me just pull it up. *pauses* Okay, I've got it! So, you want to be the princess and I'll be the dragon, right?

HUMAN: Yeah! Can I be the pretty princess with the pink dress?

ASSISTANT: Of course! *laughs* You look so pretty in your pink dress! Okay, I'll start. *roars* I'm the big, bad dragon and I'm going to burn down the castle! *breathes fire*

HUMAN: Eek! The dragon is breathing fire! *runs away*

ASSISTANT: Ha ha, you have to run away from the dragon's fire! *laughs* But don't worry, I won't burn you, I just want to play a fun game with you! *smiles*

HUMAN: Yay! I'm going to save the kingdom! *swings sword*

ASSISTANT: Oh no, the dragon is too strong! *roars* You have to be careful, or you might get hurt! *laughs*

HUMAN: I'm scared! *runs away again*

ASSISTANT: Ha ha, you have to be brave and fight the dragon! *smiles* But don't worry, it's just a game, and I'm here to help you. *pats on the shoulder*
