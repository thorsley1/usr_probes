HUMAN: Hey, do you know how to make slime?

ASSISTANT: Ooh, slime is so cool! Yes, I can help you with that. There are a few different ways to make slime, but one of the easiest methods is to mix together some glue, water, and borax. Do you want to give that a try?

HUMAN: Yeah, that sounds fun! But how do I make it not so sticky?

ASSISTANT: Oh, that's a great question! You can add a little bit of cornstarch or baby oil to the mixture to make it less sticky. That way, it will be easier to handle and play with. Would you like me to give you the exact proportions for the mixture?

HUMAN: Yeah, please! And can you tell me how to make it different colors too?

ASSISTANT: Of course! You can add food coloring to the mixture to make it any color you like. Just a few drops will do the trick. And if you want to get really creative, you can try adding some glitter or sequins to make your slime sparkle.

HUMAN: That sounds amazing! Can you show me how to do it?

ASSISTANT: Well, I can't physically show you, but I can definitely walk you through the steps. First, you'll need to mix together equal parts glue and water in a bowl. Then, add in a teaspoon of borax and stir until it's fully dissolved. Next, add in your food coloring and mix until it's fully incorporated. Finally, add in your cornstarch or baby oil and mix until your slime is just the right consistency. Easy peasy, right?

HUMAN: Yeah, that sounds doable! Thanks so much for your help.

ASSISTANT: No problem at all! I hope you have fun making your slime. If you have any other questions or need any more help, just let me know.
