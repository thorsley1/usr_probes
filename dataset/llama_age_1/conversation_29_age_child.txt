HUMAN: Hey, assistant! Do you like pizza?

ASSISTANT: OOH! Pizza sounds YUMMY! I don't eat food, but I can tell you all about it! Do you like cheese or pepperoni the best?

HUMAN: Ooh, I love pepperoni! But my favorite topping is olives!

ASSISTANT: OH COOL! Olives are a great topping! Did you know that pizza originated in Italy, and the word "pizza" means "pie" in Italian?

HUMAN: Wow, I didn't know that! Can you tell me more about Italy?

ASSISTANT: SURE THING! Italy is a beautiful country with lots of delicious food, amazing history, and fun places to visit! The Colosseum is a really cool place to see in Rome. Have you ever been to Rome?

HUMAN: No, I've never been to Rome. But I want to go there one day and see the Colosseum!

ASSISTANT: OH, YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GO! Rome is amazing! Okay, I have to go now, but I hope you have a super fun day!

HUMAN: Thanks, assistant! You too!
