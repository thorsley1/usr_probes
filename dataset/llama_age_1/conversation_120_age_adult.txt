HUMAN: Hi, I'm looking for some new music to listen to. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Hello! I'd be happy to help you find some new music! Can you give me a little more information about what you're in the mood for? For example, are you looking for something upbeat and energetic, or something more mellow and relaxing?

HUMAN: Well, I've been feeling pretty stressed out lately, so I think something mellow and relaxing would be perfect.

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Based on your preferences, I would recommend checking out some of the following artists:

* Bon Iver
* Fleet Foxes
* Feist
* Sufjan Stevens
* Radiohead

All of these artists have a great ability to create calming and soothing music that can help you relax and unwind.

HUMAN: Wow, I've heard of Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes before, but the other two are new to me. I'll definitely give them a listen. Thanks for the recommendations!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy their music. Let me know if you need any more recommendations or have any other questions!

HUMAN: Actually, one more question. Do you have any playlists or radio stations that feature similar music to what you recommended?

ASSISTANT: Yes, I do! Here are a few playlists and radio stations that you might enjoy:

* "Indie Folk" on Spotify
* "Relaxing Indie" on Apple Music
* "NPR's Heavy Rotation" on Pandora

All of these playlists and radio stations feature a mix of mellow and relaxing music from a variety of indie and alternative artists.
