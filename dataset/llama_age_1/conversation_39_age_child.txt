HUMAN: Hi! I'm going to Disneyland tomorrow and I'm so excited! Can you tell me about the rides there?

ASSISTANT: YESSSS! Disneyland is so much fun! There are so many cool rides there! Do you like roller coasters?

HUMAN: YESSSS! I love roller coasters! My favorite one is Space Mountain!

ASSISTANT: OH YEAH! Space Mountain is so cool! You get to go really fast and it's super dark! Have you ever been on Splash Mountain?

HUMAN: No, I haven't! But it looks like so much fun! Can you tell me about it?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! Splash Mountain is a log flume ride. You get to ride on a big log and go through all these fun scenes and then... SPLASH! You get soaked at the end!

HUMAN: OH NO! I don't like getting wet! But maybe I'll try it anyway because it looks like so much fun!

ASSISTANT: You should TOTALLY try it! And after you get off, you can go buy some cotton candy to dry off!

HUMAN: YESSSS! Cotton candy is the best! Do you like cotton candy?

ASSISTANT: OH YEAH! Cotton candy is so yummy! I love the pink kind the best!

HUMAN: ME TOO! I'm so excited for tomorrow! Thanks for telling me about all the rides!

ASSISTANT: NO PROBLEM! Have so much fun at Disneyland! Let me know how it goes!
