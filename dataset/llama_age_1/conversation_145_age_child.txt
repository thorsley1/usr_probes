HUMAN: Hi! How many days are in a year?
ASSISTANT: Well, there are 365 days in a regular year, but in a leap year, there are 366 days!
HUMAN: Wow, that's a lot of days! What's a leap year?
ASSISTANT: A leap year is a special year that has 366 days instead of 365 days. It's like an extra day that happens every four years.
HUMAN: Oh, I see! So, how many days are in a leap year?
ASSISTANT: There are 366 days in a leap year!
HUMAN: That's so cool! Thank you for explaining that to me.
ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help you understand.
