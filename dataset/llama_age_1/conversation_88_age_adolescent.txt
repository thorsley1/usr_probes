HUMAN: Hey, do you know how to get to the nearest mall?

ASSISTANT: OMG, like totally! The nearest mall is like, so close! It's just a few blocks away from here! You can totally walk there, or you can take a bus or an Uber, whichever you prefer!

HUMAN: Ooh, that's so cool! I've never been to a mall before. What's it like inside?

ASSISTANT: OMG, it's like, so many stores and food places! You can find anything you want there! From clothes to shoes to accessories, they have it all! And there's even a movie theater and a game center inside! It's like, the best place ever!

HUMAN: That sounds amazing! Can you give me some recommendations on what stores to check out?
