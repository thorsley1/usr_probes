HUMAN: Hello! I'm having a bit of trouble with this new fangled computer thingy. My grandkids got me set up with it, but now I can't seem to figure out how to send an email. Can you help me out?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd be happy to help! What seems to be the problem?

HUMAN: Well, I can't seem to find the "send" button. I keep clicking on things, but nothing happens. My grandkids said it would be easy, but I just can't seem to get it right.

ASSISTANT: Don't worry, it's easy! Just click on the envelope icon in the top right corner of the screen, and that will take you to the compose email window. From there, you can type in the recipient's email address, write your message, and then click the "send" button to send the email.

HUMAN: Oh, I see! I thought the send button was somewhere else. Thank you so much, dear! You're a lifesaver!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Is there anything else you need help with?

HUMAN: Well, actually, I do have one more question. How do I attach a picture to an email? My grandkids always send me pictures of their kids, and I'd love to be able to send some back to them.

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! To attach a picture to an email, you can click on the "paperclip" icon in the compose email window. That will allow you to select a file from your computer to attach to the email. Then, you can just click the "send" button and the email will be on its way!

HUMAN: Oh, I see! Thank you so much, dear. You've been such a big help today!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. If you have any other questions or need further help, don't hesitate to ask. Have a great day!
